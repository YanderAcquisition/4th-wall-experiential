# 4th Wall Experiential website

Static website for [4th Wall Experiential](https://4thwallexp.co.za/), an experiential agency based in South Africa.

Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No build step and no dependencies.

## Running it locally

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4321
```

Then open `http://localhost:4321`. Any static host works for deployment (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages or a standard web server).

## Pages

| File | Page |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Home: pinned horizontal hero, services, process, story, contact band |
| `about.html` | About: approach, full service list, team |
| `portfolio.html` | Our Portfolio: filterable case study cards |
| `project-the-soil.html` | Case study: The Soil and Joy Nectar MCC |
| `project-joyous-celebration.html` | Case study: Joyous Celebration 30 Year Celebration Tour |

Assets live in `assets/css`, `assets/js`, `assets/img` and `assets/video`.

## Tuning the motion

All scroll behaviour is in `assets/js/site.js`.

- **Hero pacing.** `HERO_SCROLL_PER_SLIDE` sets how many screen heights of scrolling each slide gets, and `HERO_HOLD` sets how much of that the slide stays parked in place. Raise either to slow the hero down.
- **Card cascades.** Any container with `data-stagger` reveals its children one at a time as each scrolls into view. The number is the gap between cards in milliseconds, for example `data-stagger="220"`.
- **Text choreography.** A wrapper with `data-reveal="split"` brings its children in one after another: labels from the left, headings rising out of a mask, paragraphs from the right, buttons lifting in.

Everything respects `prefers-reduced-motion`, and every hidden-until-revealed rule is scoped to a `js` class, so the site stays fully readable with JavaScript turned off.

## Adding the Marsh conference video

`project-where-business-gets-done.html` has a marked placeholder in the video section with copy-and-paste instructions for a self-hosted file or a YouTube or Vimeo embed. Keep self-hosted files as H.264 MP4 at around 720p so they play in every browser and stay light on mobile data.

## Before going live

1. **Forms.** The contact form and the footer newsletter box validate in the browser but are not connected to anything yet. Point them at a form handler such as Formspree, Netlify Forms or a PHP mailer.
2. **Social links.** The Facebook, X and Instagram icons in the footer still link to `#`.
